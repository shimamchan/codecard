Code Card is a Wi-Fi-enabled device with an e-paper display that can retrieve content from Oracle Cloud. Code Cards are available on a first-come basis to Oracle OpenWorld and Oracle Code One attendees who sign up for a cloud trial account. Stop by the Groundbreakers Hub to sign up and start configuring your Code Card.

There are loads of things that you can do with your Code Card - here's a list of documentation, work instructions, & code to get you up and running:

## Instructions
- **[Code Card Designer Mobile App](#code-card-mobile-app)**  
Personalise the contents of your Code Card's display using the Code Card Designer Mobile Application.  
Create different template layouts, save them to the Oracle Cloud, and then apply them to your card with the press of a button. Ths is the quickest way to get up and running.
